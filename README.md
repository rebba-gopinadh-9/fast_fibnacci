# fibonacci
the code can clearly 
give the idea of 
fast calaculating fibonacci formula but 
the formula is good for large inputs not 
the simple range of 0 to 40.
# sqrt
can calculate the simple square roots .
with 'p' as the precision 
# memory sort 
 is an O(n) sorting algorithm for 
 simple data of small range.
 if all the elements to be sorted are of 
 within the small range of numbers say ,
 m and n
 if |m-n| is small enough to the range of 
 allocated memory 
 this is useful.
